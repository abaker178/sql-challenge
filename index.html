        <h1>SQL Challenge - Pewlett Hackard</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Build practice and confidence in working with PostgreSQL, data engineering/modeling, and data analysis. This project is fictional and for academic purposes.</p>
        <h3>Premise</h3>
        <p>It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since getting hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. The first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. Design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.</p>
        <h3>Data Collected</h3>
